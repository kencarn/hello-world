A bit about me:
I have a diverse educational and professional background.
I'm a trained art historian and historian of medicine and science. 
In high school and college I also studied math and science, in addition to art and history: 
I fulfilled premed requirements and in my early years of college I took advanced math classes and 
held a computer science job. 
I worked my way through the later years of college college and part of graduate school 
through medical jobs, both on the administrative and on the clinical sides, especially 
in women's health and in occupational and environmental medicine. 
As a graduate student in history of art, I taught undergraduates in fields of art history, 
history of medicine and science, and medical anthropology. 
I was also a fellow in Germany at a research institute for history of science. I lived for
three years in Germany, mostly in Berlin.
I left academia and worked in retail in outdoor industries. I'm a long time long distance runner,
5K to marathon distance.
And while I'm a very good road racer for my age I specialize in mountain running. 
I would like to switch to data science and am probably especially interested in eventually 
focusing on visualizations.
