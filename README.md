I'm have a diverse educational and professional background.
I'm a trained art historian and historian of medicine and science. 
In high school and college I also studiend math, science. I fulfilled premed requirements.
And in college I also held a computer science job. 
I worked my way through college and part of graduate school through medical jobs, both on the
administrative and on the clinical sides, especially in women's health and in 
occupational and environmental medicine. As a graduate student in history of art, I 
taught undergraduates in fields of art history, history of medicine and science, and 
medical anthropology. I was also a fellow in Germany at a research institute for history of science.
I left academia and worked in retail in outdoor industries. I'm a long time long distance runner
and while I'm a very good road racer for my age I specialize in mountain running. 
I would like to switch to data science and am probably especially interested in eventually 
focusing on visualizations.
